# Christian Shannon

**Sr. Analyst, Data Analytics | Data Scientist**

I turn complex business questions into clear, data-driven insights using SQL, ETL, and visualization tools like Dataiku and Tableau. With 15+ years at Lincoln Financial Group, I specialize in building trustworthy data pipelines, intuitive dashboards, and analytics that leaders actually use.

---

## What I focus on

- **Analytics & BI:** Designing dashboards and reports that help business leaders make confident, data-driven decisions.
- **Data Quality & Governance:** Troubleshooting data integrity issues and improving data availability, accuracy, and consistency across systems.
- **ETL & Data Pipelines:** Building and optimizing automated workflows to move, transform, and validate data at scale.

Right now, I am completing a Bachelor of Science in Data Science at Bellevue University and applying those techniques to real business problems.
